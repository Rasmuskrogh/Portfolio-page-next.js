    "description": "Hi! I'm a former classical singer turned web developer. My expertise lies in frontend, especially TypeScript, React and Next.js. However, my <techStackLink>tech stack</techStackLink> extends beyond those frameworks. My favourite part of coding is figuring out effective solutions to big problems and then seeing my creation come to life. Others have described me as: adaptable, analytical, level-headed, passionate and quick to learn.",
